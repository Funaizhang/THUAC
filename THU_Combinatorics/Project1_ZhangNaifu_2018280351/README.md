# Project 1 Cellphone Passcodes
This projects determines which of iPhone and Android screen unlock mechanism is more secure.


## Getting Started
The zip folder contains a Project_1_Report.pdf and a Project_1.py.

You can run Project_1.py in any Python 3.5 (or later) environment. This gives the Android unlock permutations. The results and code are discussed in Project_1_Report.pdf.

On Linux, Windows or OS X, with Python installed (see below otherwise), you can alternatively run the following in Terminal at the correct directory.
```sh
$ python Project_1.py
```

If you are working with Ubantu, run
```sh
$ sudo python3 Project_1.py
```

## Installing Python 3
*Skip this section if you have a working Python 3.*

If you are working with Linux, OS X and Windows, you can download Python 3 at [python.org](https://www.python.org/getit/).

The installation procedure over command prompt is not as straight forward, so please refer to this [online guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) for details of your system.

The entire process should will take a few minutes, or up to something like half an hour if starting from scratch.

## Installing IDE
*Skip this section if you have a working Python 3 IDE, or if you choose to run the script in Terminal.*

Author recommends PyCharm or Anaconda. Atom requires installation of additional community add-ons for Python 3 - further details on Atom website.
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/quick-start-guide.html)
* [Anaconda](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/#)
* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html)
* [Atom](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/)


## Author System Specifications
These specifications are not needed to run the script, but are needed to reproduce the runtime stated in Project_1_Report.pdf.

If user is using any other OS or specifications, actual runtime might differ (but not hugely). Relative performance of the algorithms and other results would not change.

**OS X** version 10.11.6  
**Processor** 2.5 GHz Intel Core i5  
**Memory** 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3  
**Graphics** Intel HD Graphics 4000 1536 MB
